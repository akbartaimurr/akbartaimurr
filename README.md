Hi! I'm Taimur, a sort-of computer geek that loves programming. With a background in programming for over 4 years, I find it fun making websites and applications and sharing them to the world.

### lets talk about me?

I'm currently studying in year 8 (IGCSE standard's) but that doesn't mean I don't have the programming knowledge. Infact I've joined lot's of web development classes, although I'm still learning game dev! My programming Journey has lead me to contributing some-what in Microsoft's WSA app, I made a keymapper for it.

Outside the world of tech and programming, I have more hobbies! I enjoy interior design or visualizing aesthetic rooms, possibly inspired by my mom, who is an amazing Interior Designer! You'll also often find me reading some of my favorite books like Percy Jackson.
